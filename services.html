     <h2>Laptop Repair</h2>
<p>Repairing a laptop will be on the latter side of repairs, whereas repairing a mouse or a keyboard for PC will be on the cheaper side, of course still depending on the damage of said item and the time it may take. The price may also vary above £250 range if the repair turns out to be a hardware problem, then a replacement will of course be needed along with the cost of said repair, the problem may be strictly Sofware, in which case replacement parts will not be needed for repair.</p>
