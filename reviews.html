  <li>Anonomous - "Good selection, friendly staff and regular sales and deals" 5/5 </li>
   <div id="bannerimage"></div>
  <li>Matthew Byrne - "Recently had a problem with a GPU purchased from the Web store. Contacted the company via a free, independent issue resolution service, the correspondence between The Computing Penguins and myself was helpful with all staff being professional and polite. The issue was resolved quickly with an explanation and a good will gesture, I will continue to use The Computing Penguins and highly recommend this company." 5/5 </li>
   <div id="bannerimage"></div>
<li>Gerald - "Good service, staff and prices. Dissapointing that they tie themselves to HP printers so have very limited competitive ranges. Was also a little disappointed to receive misleading advice that made me purchase and then have to travel back to get a refund when item proved not fit for my particular purpose but fully appreciate that the young man did his best.  He might have been more knowledgeable and that would've saved a wasted 60 mile round trip for me. However I was relieved to receive an apology and a full refund together with advice for future purchases." 4/5 </li>
   <div id="bannerimage"></div>
<li>Sandra - "Staff member was very helpful but shop tech side let them down.  Couldn't take payment so wanted us to buy a gift card and then use gift card to buy items, don't think so.  Staff were embarassed but management seemed to think it was ok.  Seemed a bit fraudulent to us so we took our trade elsewhere.  Very disappointing." 1/5 </li>
   <div id="bannerimage"></div>
  <li>George - "A shop with a good range and people who genuinely help. The printer I wanted was out of stock and the assistant asked what I used it for. After checking the specifications of those in stock a cheaper one was found that would still meet my requirements. A good result all round" 5/5</li>
